This repository shows the codes and sources used to carry out the AI part of a research projects titled as follows: "Proposal of a muon tomography model and evaluation 
of AI image processing based techniques for cancer detection".
When it comes to the particle physics section of the work, we proposed a tomography model for cancer detection based on the study of particles and matter. After that, 
we went deeply into the machine and deep learning field. The aim of this section was to evaluate the algorithms and software that could be used to have this automatic 
response for the diagnosis of cancer from the CRC100K data set of images.
With WEKA Explorer, we were able to determine K-Star (a kNN based algorithm) as the one with the highest accuracy of CRC-VAL-HE-7k data set. Apart from kNN based 
algorithms, Random Forest is one also giving an outstanding accuracy.
After that, we implemented those algorithms in Jupyter Notebook for both CRC-VAL-HE-7k and NCT-CRC-HE-100k, to carry on a proper comparison. The difference between the
data sets is the quantity of data they have.
